# Hi, I'm Emily!
I am a Bay Area native and in my spare time, I enjoy exploring new food spots, cooking, and hiking. I am a second-year MURP focusing on community economic development and housing. Prior to attending UCLA, I worked in environmental planning analyzing the environmental impacts of new housing and transportation projects. I chose to pursue a degree in urban planning to better understand barriers to building housing and identify opportunities to enhance housing policies to streamline development.

## Course Description and Objectives
My understanding is this course will help us utilize Python to create maps from existing data sets. Through this course, I hope to better understand coding, basics to using Python, and creating maps to present data in a more visually appealing way. I have very little ArcGIS map experience and have not used it in years, so I am exicted to refresh my understanding of the map-creation process and learn the basics to coding to create maps. 

## Project Ideas
I am interested in exploring the geographic distribution of new 2-to-4 housing unit projects in California to analyze the effectiveness of SB 9 and SB 10, identify where most small multi-family housing is being built, and where displacement is most prevelant or areas most at-risk for gentrification.
